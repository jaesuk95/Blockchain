<h4>Why you should consider Cryptocurrency as payment?</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrency is considered more secure than credit and debit card payments.</p>
<p>This is because cryptocurrencies do not need third-party verification. </p>
<p>When a customer pays with cryptocurrency, their data isn't stored in a </p>
<p>centralized hub where data breaches commonly occur</p>
