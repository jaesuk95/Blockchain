<h4>Why you should consider Cryptocurrency as payment?</h4>

Cryptocurrency is considered more secure than credit and debit card payments.
This is because cryptocurrencies do not need third-party verification. 
When a customer pays with cryptocurrency, their data isn't stored in a 
centralized hub where data breaches commonly occur

Nearly 20% of all U.S. adults say theyâ€™re likely to make a purchase using crypto, according to a recent report by PYMNTS.com
<h6>Crypto transactions are also relatively anonymous</h6>

Transactions are made anonymously and recorded and secured using blockchain technology, which is similar to a bank ledger. 
Purchased through crypto exchanges and stored in the user's digital wallet, crypto facilitates faster, more confidential 
transactions without the typical fees associated with card payments
